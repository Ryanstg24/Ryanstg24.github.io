## Category 1: Software Engineering and Design
Showcasing my work from CS-210 Programming Languages, Project 2. This was a compounding calculator which was designed to take an initial investment, monthly deposit, interest, and then calculate your money over x amount of years of investing.

## Category 2: Algorithms and Data Structures
Showcasing my work from CS-340 Client/Server Development, Project 2. This project was a dashboard created for Grazioso Salvare to allow users to interactively filter and visualize data related to animal rescues based on certain conditions and types. All while allowing filters for certain types of rescue dogs required. It provides an intuitive user interface where the data can be visualized through tables, pie charts, and interactive maps.

## Category 3: Databases
Using the same artifact from Categlory 2, we will make additional enhancements. With a focus centered around the MongoDB dashboard and CRUD operations. This showcases the project's dual signifance in showcasing competencies in both Algorithms and Data Structures as well as Database Management.
