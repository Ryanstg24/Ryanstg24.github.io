## Category 2: Algorithms and Data Structures
Showcasing my work from CS-340 Client/Server Development, Project 2. This project was a dashboard created for Grazioso Salvare to allow users to interactively filter and visualize data related to animal rescues based on certain conditions and types. All while allowing filters for certain types of rescue dogs required. It provides an intuitive user interface where the data can be visualized through tables, pie charts, and interactive maps.
